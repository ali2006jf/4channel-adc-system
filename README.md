# 🔍 4-Channel High-Resolution ADC Board for Zynq

This repository contains design files for a high-performance, synchronized 4-channel analog-to-digital converter (ADC) board, specifically tailored to interface with **Zynq SoC platforms**.

## 🧠 Overview

The board captures **4 single-ended analog signals**, conditions them using precision amplifiers, and digitizes them using **four AD7762 ADC chips**. Each channel is independently processed but fully **synchronized**, enabling coherent multi-channel sampling — ideal for signal processing and measurement applications.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🎯 **4x AD7762** 24-bit high-resolution ADCs (one per channel)
- 🎚️ **4x AD4945** analog front-end amplifiers
- 🔁 Fully **synchronized ADC operation** (SYNC, RESET, DRDY lines)
- 🔌 Input: **+10V** single supply, onboard regulation to ±2.5V and references
- 🔗 Designed for **direct parallel interface with Zynq**
- 🎛️ Integrated filtering, decoupling, and precise reference (ADR434)
- 🧩 Suitable for embedded applications, instrumentation, and data acquisition

## 🛠️ Usage Notes

- All ADCs are connected to a Zynq platform via a 16-bit parallel bus.
- Control lines like `SYNC`, `RESET`, `RD/WR`, and `CS` are shared and synchronized.
- Output data lines are routed with careful impedance and length matching.

## 🧪 Applications

- Synchronous multi-channel data acquisition
- Embedded test & measurement systems
- Industrial signal monitoring
- Biomedical signal capture
